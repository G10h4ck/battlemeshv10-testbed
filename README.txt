step 1: 
 - define management and test network

Notes for the future battlemeshers:
 - have two separate testbeds: one big one "production", one small one for debugging. Everytime one protocol finds a bug or some extra configuration are required, the devs will use the small one, without locking the production one.
 - use cables. It would be best to have a mangement network that works, so consider using ethernet to deploy the management network (maybe Power-line?).
